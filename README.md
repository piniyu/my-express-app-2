This project involves building a simple RESTful API for managing a "Task List" application. This exercise will cover various aspects of backend development, including routing, authentication, database integration, and error handling.

# Project: Task List RESTful API

Project Description:
Create a RESTful API for managing tasks. Users should be able to perform the following actions:

Create a new task with a title and description.

- Read a list of all tasks.
- Read a specific task by its ID.
- Update a task's title or description by its ID.
- Delete a task by its ID.
- Requirements:

### Express.js:

Use the Express.js framework to build the API.

### MongoDB or a Database of Choice:

Choose a database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL) and integrate it with your Node.js application. Store tasks in the database.

### User Authentication:

Implement user authentication using a library like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users should be able to create accounts and log in.

### API Endpoints:

Create endpoints for each of the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for tasks.
Use appropriate HTTP methods (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) and route handlers to implement these endpoints.
Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that task data is valid before saving it to the database. You can use a validation library like Joi.

### Error Handling:

Implement error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid requests, database errors, and authentication failures. Return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages in your API responses.

### Middleware:

Use middleware functions to handle tasks like authentication, request logging, and error handling. Middleware should be applied as needed to specific routes.

### Testing:

Write unit tests and integration tests for your API using testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest. Ensure that your tests cover different scenarios and edge cases.

### Documentation:

Create API documentation that explains how to use your endpoints. You can use tools like Swagger or API Blueprint for documentation.

### Deployment:

Deploy your Node.js application and the associated database to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. Provide instructions on how to access the live API.

### Optional Enhancements:

#### Pagination:

Implement pagination for listing tasks to avoid overwhelming the client with a large number of results.

#### Sorting and Filtering:

Allow users to sort and filter tasks based on criteria such as date, priority, or status.

#### User Roles and Permissions:

Implement different user roles (e.g., regular user, admin) and define permissions for accessing certain endpoints.

#### Task Status:

Add a status field to tasks (e.g., "completed," "in progress") and implement functionality to update task status.

#### File Upload:

Allow users to attach files to tasks, such as images or documents.

#### Email Notifications:

Send email notifications for task updates or reminders.

#### Real-Time Updates:

Implement WebSocket functionality for real-time updates when tasks are created or updated.

This project exercise will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of building a RESTful API with Node.js, including handling authentication, database operations, error handling, and testing. As you work through this project, refer to online resources and documentation to help you tackle specific challenges along the way. Good luck, and happy coding!
